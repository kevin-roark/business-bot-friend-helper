# business-bot-friend-helper

This is a great bot that uses twitter streams to track all of the tweets from a
particular account that you follow and sends a follow-up email to the recipient
of your choice about how much you loved the article mentioned in the tweet. Once
you have found the bottom of the ladder that you want to climb, this will help
you climb the ladder. Higher than the ladder.

## Usage

Just fill in twitter api info and gmail app password and you should be ready
to go.

`npm run start`
